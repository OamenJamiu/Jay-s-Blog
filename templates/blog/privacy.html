    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Jay's Blog (we” or “us”) values its visitors’ privacy. This privacy policy is effective 2019; it summarizes what
    information we might collect from a registered user or other visitor (“you”), and what we will and will not do with it.
    <br>
    Please note that this privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that Jay's
    Blog does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by Jay's Blog. If you visit a Web site that we
    mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information.
    <br>
    <h2>
        <p>What we do with your personally identifiable information</p>
    </h2>
    <br>
    It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you elect not to do
    so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. “Personally
    identifiable information” means information that can be used to identify you as an individual, such as, for example:
    
    your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address, and shipping address
    your Company Name user ID and password
    credit card information
    
    The above provision may not be appropriate if credit card information is handled by a payment processor.
    
    any account-preference information you provide us
    your computer’s domain name and IP address, indicating
    where your computer is located on the Internet
    session data for your login session, so that our computer can ‘talk’ to yours while you are logged in
    
    If you do provide personally identifiable information to us, either directly or through a reseller or other business
    partner, we will:
    
    not sell or rent it to a third party without your permission — although unless you opt out (see below), we may use your
    contact information to provide you with information we believe you need to know or may find useful, such as (for
    example) news about our services and products and modifications to the Terms of Service;
    take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
    disclosure, alteration and destruction;
    not use or disclose the information except:
    as necessary to provide services or products you have ordered, such as (for example) by providing it to a carrier to
    deliver products you have ordered;
    in other ways described in this privacy policy or to which you have otherwise consented;
    in the aggregate with other information in such a way so that your identity cannot reasonably be determined (for
    example, statistical compilations);
    as required by law, for example, in response to a subpoena or search warrant;
    to outside auditors who have agreed to keep the information confidential;
    as necessary to enforce the Terms of Service;
    as necessary to protect the rights, safety, or property of Jay's Blog, its users, or others; this may include (for
    example) exchanging information with other organizations for fraud protection and/or risk reduction.

    </h2>
    <br>
    We may collect other information that cannot be readily used to identify you, such as (for example) the domain name and
    IP address of your computer. We may use this information, individually or in the aggregate, for technical administration
    of our Web site(s); research and development; customer- and account administration; and to help us focus our marketing
    efforts more precisely.
